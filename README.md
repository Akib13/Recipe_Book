# Shop-App
A basic app using Angular and Firebase. It is built just to show the data flow in the whole application.

Both the file will give same output, but the approach is different.
*The "ngrx" method is for handling very big scale apps. For an app with daily use it can be avoided.
*The "service" method is easy to understand and control. It is recommended for average scale apps.

To run:
0. (Pre-requisites): first make sure you have 1.npm, 2.nodejs, 3.angular/cli is installed. The installation process for npm and nodejs can be found online easily. But angular/cli can be installed by the command: '(sudo) npm install -g @angular/cli@latest'.
1. Go to any of the project directory and open a terminal.
2. run '(sudo) npm install --force'. (Here, sudo is not always mandatory)
3. run 'ng serve'
4. Now the terminal will show a link like 'http://localhost:4200/'. Go to the link and if you are lucky it may run without any error.
